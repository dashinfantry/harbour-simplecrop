# Imageworks editor, harbour-simplecrop package

Sailfish OS Imageworks is the most complete photo editor and image manipulation app for SailfishOS to date. 

It provides a huge amount of functions, effects and editing possibilities.

IMPORTANT:
This app furthermore requires python3-pillow, (also in this repo or on openrepos.net). Make sure to install only one of them. Instructions on how to do this are provided inside the app ... don't worry, it is simple.
